# Plotto

Plotto - A new method of plot suggestion for writers of creative fiction  
by William Wallace Cook, 1867-1933  
Published 1928

This project's goal is to take the raw Plotto text and convert it into a
format that can be easily parsed and hyperlinked.

Electronic copies of this book (in a variety of formats) can be found at archive.org:

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get a feel of what Plotto offers is to simply jump to a [random plot conflict](http://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-mf.html?random) and then begin exploring.

A detailed description of how to use Plotto can be found in the (aptly named) [How to Use Plotto](how-to.md) document.

It is important to note that the conflicts described in Plotto are not intended to be taken literally and applied verbatim. Rather, they are suggestions that you should adapt to fit the story that you want to tell.

## Plotto and Modern Times

Plotto was published in the late 20's and was written over the course of the preceding decades. During this period of history the Titanic sunk, we learned how to fly, there was a world war, and women gained the right to vote in the US. Notably missing from this period of time are things that we often take for granted in the modern world: many conveniences afforded by advances in technology and, significantly, the notiona of civil and equal rights.

The outdated ideas on race can sometimes lead to some jarring experiences:

* [650](http://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-mf.html#650) "a white man cast away among bloodthirsty savages",
* [332](http://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-mf.html#332) "B, of alien blood and inferior race, seeks to marry A, the Caucasian with whom she is in love"
* [718](http://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-mf.html#718) "A, believed by all to be a white man, knows there is negro blood in his veins"

The implicit sexism in Plotto is more subtle, but the rigid structure of the books permits an interesting experiment. Since the "A" protagonist is male and the "B" protagonist is female, we can swap the two roles and see if any of the resulting text sounds a bit "odd".

To experiment with this, you can use the [gender-swapped version of Plotto](http://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-fm.html). The content is exactly the same as the original, except that "A" and "B" are swapped, along with any gendered terms ("him/her", "husband/wife", ...) in the text.

You can also choose the gender-swapped version from the `AB` dropdown menu at the top of the page.
